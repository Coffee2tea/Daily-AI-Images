    "content": "### 1. Oversized Silhouettes & Layering\n\nOversized silhouettes remain at the heart of best street wear for 2025. Baggy pants, boxy jackets, and loose shirts dominate both runways and city streets. Layering is not just about warmth, but about crafting a unique identity through mixing textures, lengths, and colors.\n\nThis trend has broad appeal due to its comfort and gender-neutral design. Influencers and celebrities are often seen pairing oversized hoodies with wide-legged trousers, creating a balanced yet bold look. Search volumes for \"oversized streetwear\" have surged in 2024, reflecting growing interest in relaxed fits. [...] ### 6. Deconstructed & DIY Aesthetics\n\nDeconstructed and DIY aesthetics are redefining the best street wear landscape. Patchwork designs, visible seams, and raw-edged finishes are now highly sought after. This trend celebrates imperfection and authenticity, giving each piece a handcrafted feel.\n\nCustomization is key. Hand-painted designs, one-of-one pieces, and upcycled garments are popular among those seeking uniqueness. Community-driven workshops and DIY collectives encourage creativity and self-expression.\n\nMaison Margiela’s deconstructed collections have inspired a wave of innovation across the industry. For those looking to embrace this trend, focus on pieces that showcase craftsmanship and individuality. [...] ### 5. Y2K Nostalgia & Retro Revivals\n\nThe early 2000s have made a striking comeback in the best street wear world. Y2K-inspired styles—think velour tracksuits, trucker hats, and metallic finishes—are everywhere. Pop culture icons and viral TikTok aesthetics are fueling this revival.\n\nBrands like adidas and Juicy Couture are reissuing archival pieces, while new labels reinterpret retro details for a modern audience. The result is a playful blend of old-school charm and contemporary edge.\n\nTo modernize Y2K looks, balance nostalgic items with updated basics. Pair a vintage-style hat with a sleek bomber jacket or metallic pants with a neutral top. The best street wear of 2025 thrives on mixing eras and influences, making retro revivals both fresh and relevant.",

    "content": "The retro look trend is bringing back the aesthetics of the 90s and early 2000s. Baggy jeans, oversized shirts, and accessories such as bucket hats are making a strong comeback. These trends combine nostalgia with modern elements and create a casual but stylish look.   \nToday, we are specifically looking at seven trends that will accompany us in streetwear fashion in 2025.\n\nBUY APPAREL\n\nTREND NO. 1 - SHORT SHORTS [...] TREND NO 6. - FLORAL & ANIMAL PATTERNS\n\nFlowers, plants and trees will be seen much more often on streetwear clothing in 2025. Floral patterns have already been popular this year. Shirts in particular are perfect for showcasing floral patterns. Gone are the days of kitschy Hawaiian shirts. The new models are characterized by filigree illustrations and all-over prints. But they will soon be seen more often on pants too. Whether denim or chinos, floral patterns make every pair of trousers an eye-catcher. Animal patterns such as leopard or zebra are also emerging from the tasteless corner and enhancing clothing more and more.\n\nTREND NO. 7 - DENIM ALL OVER [...] TREND NO. 4 - PASTEL COLORS\n\nIn the sneaker trends 2025, one prediction was that bright colors would be a theme. Streetwear clothing will be more subtle and pastel shades will be seen more. Colors such as pistachio, sky blue, coral, lemon or washed-out pink are already popular for T-shirts. However, other tops such as jackets, sweatshirts and even pants will soon be available in these colors. These items do not necessarily need large prints or patterns, as the color already makes a statement.\n\nTREND NO. 5 - POLO SHIRTS",

    "content": "Takashi Murakami’s legacy was stamped many years ago. Yet the Japanese artist found exciting ways to capture the streetwear world’s attention in 2025. Some of it was a nod to the past, like a revival of his iconic collaborations with Louis Vuitton to celebrate their 20th anniversary. He also partnered with Major League Baseball to commemorate moments like the Tokyo Series and the Dodgers World Series title. His iconic flowers and characters were splashed across jerseys, hats, and trading cards. Murakami’s colorful motifs are once again a defining piece of another era of streetwear. –Mike DeStefano\n\n## 8. Denim Tears [...] Denim Tears’ Cotton Wreath is still everywhere. This year, the brand’s signature design has been remixed in fresh ways, from Swarovski crystals to camouflage. But please don’t write Tremaine Emory’s brand off as a one-hit wonder. Throughout 2025, it continued to showcase its ability to evolve through new collections and collaborations like Stüssy Tears, Levi’s, and an expertly-timed drop with Tyshawn Jones’ Hardies shortly after news broke of the skater’s lawsuit against Supreme. Beyond designs and drops, Denim Tears excelled at one of the key pillars of streetwear, bringing the community together, through pop-ups across the country and block parties. [...] Birth of Royal Child (BORC) blew up off of one viral idea: sparkle, sparkle, sparkle. Its signature “20K Diamond” denim, bedazzled with tons of Swarovski crystals, dominated social media and had some of the biggest names in music rocking a pair, from Future to Lisa of Blackpink. But BORC isn’t just being worn by big names. It’s also working with them. For its ComplexCon debut in October 2025, it debuted a collab with headliner Young Thug. The brand has proven that it’s not just a one-hit wonder. –Shinnie Park\n\n## 18. Basketcase\n\nStandout Moments: Debuting its New Balance 204L collaboration during Paris Fashion Week, an official collab with Disney sold in Selfridges",

I'm not sure if that's based out of Japan. I would assume so. But being Japanese, I love finding uh little bits and pieces of Japanese culture in graphics or if the shirt or materials are actually from Japan. This was mainly first inspired by our first Common Studios product ever, Japanese canvas, which was a pretty cool full circle moment for uh me as a person and as a creator. Um, but I'm getting sidetracked right now. Solid graphic T for Friday. We'll throw this one on.

They are a lighter nylon, but like if you know wearing nylon when you're sweating, it just feels like a wet garbage bag is on your skin. So, that part kind of sucked. But I do love this pant and I was inside most of the day, so it didn't really affect me all that much. Sometimes you just got to do it for the fit. So, I went with these No Fear. I don't really want to call them snowboarding pants, but we'll call them snowboarding pants. And uh yeah, not my smartest outfit. I almost just did the mic thing again. I'm going to crash out. [Music] Another good vintage tea on Friday. It's this Japanese geisha on the front which is really solid. I like the colors in this one as well. If you guys can pick up on those magentas and the purples, the plums. Um, and I really like the pop of [...] have a lot of good life left in them. But yeah, you guys know I wear these all the time.

I think every time I finish a sentence and I look at the camera I just feel the need to take the mic off and I think that's why that's happening. [Music] T-shirt for Saturday.
